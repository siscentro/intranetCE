<h2>Testing Messages</h2>

<?php echo Template::message(); ?>

<p>The main advantage of using Ocular's messaging system (as opposed to CodeIgniter's built-in flash messages) is that flash messages only work on a page refresh. Ocular will work both with and without a page refresh. Actually, it uses CI's flash messages to work on a page refresh so no code is duplicated.</p>
